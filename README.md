# Onion Architecture Boilerplate

### DESCRIPTION

This repository is a real life example of Onion Architecture with use of `Node.js / Express` and `Typescript`

### BUSINESS CONTEXT

Project is a simple Nest API

#### Structure

1.  core ( `Application Core` )

        Contains application core related layers like application services, domain and domain services

2.  dependency ( `Dependency injection layer` )

        Contains definition for Container and whole project dependencies

3.  infrastructure

        Contains definition of data sources in case of this boilerplate - database

4.  ui

        Contains definition of presentation layer like controller, express setup etc

#### Data flow

It's important to keep data flow as simple as possible. Generally it's simple to follow - for entry data always specify request object,
for output translate data to specific layer. For easier understanding I've prepared a diagram.

#### Architecture layers access restrictions

Every layer has its own rules when it comes to access to another layer.

- `Dependency injection` has access to every layer to provide proper implementations.
- `UI` have access only to `Core Layer`
  - `Domains` can be grouped into `Bounded Context`
  - Given `Domains` do not see each other, but defines `protocol` of communication like `CLI`, `REST` etc.
- `Infrastructure` have access only to `Core Layer`
  - `Functionalities` can be grouped into `Functionality Group` like `Messaging`, `Persistence` etc
  - Given `Functionalities` do not see each other, but have access to `Data Source`
- `Core Layer` don`t have access to any layer. It means that it's fully independent of implementations and can be
  extracted from project if needed
  - `Application Service` here have access to `Domain Services` and `Domain Models`
  - `Domain Serivce` have access only to domain models, and `Domain Services` don`t see one each other
  - `Domain Model` don`t have access to any upper layer

Visual representation of above restrictions can be seen in a diagram.

#### Architecture layers in details

To understand in details how whole architecture works together with applied design patterns etc take a look
at detailed diagrams per layer.

#### Architecture Growth Lifecycle

It's natural that every project evolve with time. From my perspective process of growth can be divided into specific phases.

- Initial Phase
  - Introducing `Onion Architecture` to project by `layering` codebase - separating code into `UI`, `CORE`, `INFRASTRUCTURE` layers
- Bounded Context Phase
  - Grouping domains into `Bounded Contexts`
- Bounded Context Growth Phase
  - Separating whole project into `Multiple Bounded Contexts`
- Modularization Phase
  - Dividing Project into `Modules`. Usually you will notice that you can rollback your code to `Initial Phase` as modules are separation was
    based on `Bounded Contexts`
- Modularization Growth Phase
  - Every `Module` evolve in its own pace up to `Bounded Context Growth Phase`. You may have also `Common Module` which is shared across other modules.
- Microservices Phase
  - After some time you may notice that having multiple modules within one codebase is too much, or you may se that specific module is a potential candidate to `Microservice`.
    If you decide to detach `Module` into `Microservice` you may start application lifecycle from the beginning or from any phase you like up to `Modularization Growth Phase`.
    You may even start from initial phase and move through all the phases within specific `Microservice`. Every `Microservice Architecture lifecycle` is independent ( like in `Modularization Growth Phase`)

Visual representation of above process can be seen in a diagram.

#### Database Structure

To have better context on general example of architecture, it's also good to understand database structure and how whole project structure
is aligned to it.
